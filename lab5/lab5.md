## Reflection

In the second half of this quarter, I think the coolest thing I learned is bash. I find it really cool that we can create bash scripts that can automate things in the terminal. It was also interesting to see how Java and bash are quite different and even though the syntax for bash is extremely strange, I still enjoyed using it.
